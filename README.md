# Twitch Authentication Go Samples
Here you will find sample Go apps illustrating how to authenticate Twitch API calls using the OAuth2 and OIDC authorization code flows, as well as the OAuth2 client credentials flow.

## Installation
```sh
$ go get -u github.com/twitchdev/authentication-go-sample
```

## Usage
Before running each sample, you will need to set two configuration variables at the top of `main.go`:

1. `CLIENT_ID` - This is the Client ID of your registered application. You can register an application in your [dashboard](https://glass.twitch.tv/console/apps).
2. `CLIENT_SECRET` - This is the secret generated for you when you register your application; do not share this. In a production environment, it is STRONGLY recommended that you do not store application secrets in your source code.

Optionally, you may modify the requested scopes and/or claims. 

After setting these variables, you may run the server from within each directory:

```sh
$ go run main.go
```

The access token will be shown in the console.
